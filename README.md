# PhD-interview-questions
Please Do not fork the repository ... Download the data and create your own repository, and only share it with me so other candidates will not see your code.
Folder 1 contains the data for the first exercise, and Folder 2 contains the data for the second exercise.

### Please read the instructions carefully:

**There are no wrong or right answers; this exercise allows us to see how you are willing to learn and how you code. You will share the code using any platform, e.g., GitHub, Jupiter notebooks, etc. Although it is ideal to share it through one of these platforms and send me the link or share it with me, you can send the script directly to me via email** 

#### Exercise 1
Write a python/R function (or both) that executes the following equation on the attached data file.
Please do not use available functions.
Y = ((x_i- x_minimum))/((x_maximum-x_minimum))

#### Exercise 2
The file is an open-access microarray data file showing values of different gene expressions in children with autism and the control group.
Can you develop/choose a predictive model to predict which genes are associated with higher risks of autism?
- Please note the data is already processed, but more exploratory data analysis and data engineering, including data augmentation, is welcome
-  you can choose any model, including machine learning models
- The code should have comments that explain each step; in the comments, please explain what metrics you are using to assess the models and why

**You will send this by Thursday, 16th May, at 12 p.m (mid-day) to allow the interview panel to review it**

Best wishes,
Sara
